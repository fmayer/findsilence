Thank you for downloading findsilence.

INSTALLATION
If you are running a POSIX system you can install findsilence by running
'python setup.py install' if you have got setuptools installed. 
If you do not want to install the software but still want to use it, you can
just run the 'gui.py' file in the findsilence directory.
Windows users are advised to double-click on gui.py in order to run the 
program, although this is untested.

NOTES
Please mind that findsilence does only accept wav files as input, so if
you have your file as an mp3 or ogg, you will have to manually decode it 
to wav. For POSIX users I would recommend using "lame --decode" and "oggdec"
respectively.
